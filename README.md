# Kossel-XL
Kossel XL Marlin new Menu

create Folder KXL_new and copy the Arduino Files into it

I´ve made changes to the "prepare menu" Many of these changes are based on the dimension of
my kossel XL. So check the dimensions of your Delta. This is really important!!!

I´m using a full graphic smart controller. Change the LCD if needed

To find the changes I´ve made search "in all sketches" for "p_k_3pdk" and you will find all changes I´ve made.
